This code is the essential computational foundation of several recent preprints:
1. Classifying multiplets of totally real cubic fields, https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.12187,
2. Construction and classification of p-ring class field modulo p-admissible conductors, https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00979,
3. Generalized Artin pattern of heterogeneous multiplets of dihedral fields and proof of Scholz's conjecture, https://arxiv.org/abs/1904.06148.
